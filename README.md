# Footbal Match Prediction - Belgian Jupiler Pro-League

## Introduction 
This is a teamwork project, aiming to develop a comprehensive system capable of accurately predicting the outcomes of football matches in the Belgian Jupiler Pro League. By combining data scraping, machine learning, and data visualization techniques, we will create a robust tool for analyzing historical match data, extracting relevant features, and building predictive models.

### Key Objectives:

**Data Acquisition:** Efficiently scrape data from football websites, including date, time, match statistics and real-time odds.
**Data Processing:** Clean and preprocess the scraped data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.
**Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features that capture the essential aspects of football matches, such as season, head-to-head records, and match performance.
**Model Development:** Train and evaluate various machine learning models to predict match outcomes, considering factors like home advantage, team strength and goal-scoring trends.
**Visualization:** Develop a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to visualize predictions, real-time data, and model performance.
**Automation:** Implement Airflow to automate the data pipeline, ensuring timely updates and efficient execution of tasks.


## Data Acquisition
### Data Scriping

### Data Base



## Data Preprocessing
The entire DataFrame consists of 92 columns, which are structured but require significant cleaning, including the handling of null values, convert 'Date' and 'Time' into usable features.
